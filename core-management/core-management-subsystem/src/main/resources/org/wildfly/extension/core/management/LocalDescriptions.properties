core-management.add=Add the core-management subsystem.
core-management.remove=Remove the core-management subsystem.

core-management.configuration-changes.max-history=The maximum number of configuration changes stored in history.
core-management.configuration-changes.list-changes=List the last configuration changes.

core-management.unstable-api-annotations=Service to configure how we deal with finding annotations indicating unstable API in user code.
core-management.unstable-api-annotations.add=Add the history for configuration changes.
core-management.unstable-api-annotations.remove=Remove the configuration changes and clear the history.
core-management.unstable-api-annotations.level=Whether to throw an error or log a warning if annotations indicating unstable API.

core-management.process-state-listener.add=Add the process-state-listener service.
core-management.process-state-listener.add-index=Add the process-state-listener serviceat the specified index.
core-management.process-state-listener.class=Class name of the listener.
core-management.process-state-listener.module=Module Identifier of the listener.
core-management.process-state-listener.properties=Properties to initiate the process state listener.
core-management.process-state-listener.remove=Remove the process-state-listener service.
core-management.process-state-listener.timeout=Duration value before cancelling the execution of a listener.

core-management.thread-pinning-recorder=Monitors the JVM for occurrences of virtual threads pinning their carrier thread, logging such occurrences and recording their number and duration.
core-management.thread-pinning-recorder.add=Adds the thread-pinning-recorder service.
